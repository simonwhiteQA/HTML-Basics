You will be creating a web page with multiple pages, each page will have a separate responsibility in terms of making requests to an API online.

Use this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
You must have a page for GET requests, a page for POST requests, a page for PUT requests and a page for delete requests
Your GET requests page must display the returned data in a table, your other pages must display some kind of confirmation message
You must have a navigation bar to navigate between your pages
Focus on functionality (HTML and JS), style afterwards (CSS)
